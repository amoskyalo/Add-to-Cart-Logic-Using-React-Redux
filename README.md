After reading about React Redux, I decided to test my understanding by building this simple project where you can add items to cart. You can check the live demo of the project here. This is what I was able to implement in this project:
  - Add an item to cart. 
  - Delete an item from cart.
  - Increase the quantity of an item in the cart.
  - Persist cart data to client local storage.
 
 ## Want to contribute.

  5. To contribute to this repo, you will create a pull request, after reviewing your changes, I will merge them, and congatulations, you have contributed to my repo!
  
## Packages used in this project
It will be wise if I mention the technologies I used in this simple application. If you want to read more about them, I will provide the links to the official documentations:

  ### 1. React Redux
  React redux is a state management liblary. 
  > From the official docs, they say, React Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.

Redux helps you manage the state of your application globaly. 
To install React Redux to your application, you will run `npm i react-redux`
To read more about React Redux, you can read the official [ docummentation here](https://react-redux.js.org/)

  ### 2. Redux toolkit
  The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
  - Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
  - I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
  - Redux requires too much boilerplate code
To install redux toolkit, run `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit`
If you want to dig deeper into React Redux toolkit, you can do that [here](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

  ### 3. Redux Persist
  Redux persist helps us to persist store data into persistable storage such as local storage. This means that our data will not be lost even after refreshing our browser. I used this package to make sure that I persist cart data - users will not lose their cart data after refreshing their browsers.
  To install Redux Persist, run `npm i redux-persist`
  To dig deeper into Redux Persist, visit the official [docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist)
  
  ### 4. React Router
  To navigate to different locations in our application, we will need React Router, to enable routing. For example, navigating to cart page. 
  > From the official docs, they say, React Router enables "client side routing". 
  
  To install React Router, you can run `npm i react-router`
  React Router contains three packages:
   - React Router
   - React-router-native
   - React-router-dom
 React-router-dom is the package designed for web applications. So you will also need to install this package.
 To install React-router-dom, you will run `npm i react-router-dom`
 Check the official React Router documentations [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview)
  
  ### 5. React Icons
  Of course I used some icons in this application, like the cart icons. I used react icons. 
  To install react icons package, run `npm i react-icons`
  You can also check them [here](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
  
 Thank you for checking out my repo developer!
